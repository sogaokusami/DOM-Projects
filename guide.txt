This is a brief guide to this repo. I am following along with the practice projects from John Smilga's Javascript Tutorial & Projects course on Udemy. 

My goal is to build my understanding and skills by coding along with each project and reviewing the code to make sure I understand the thinking behind it.

I will also use this as an opportunity to practice using Git and Github. I have created a local repo and will have a branch for each project I work on. I will push each project branch when complete to my remote github repo. 

Thanks for reading!
