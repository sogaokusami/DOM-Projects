This is a brief guide to this repo. I am following along with the practice projects from John Smilga's Javascript Tutorial & Projects course on Udemy. 

My goal is to build my understanding and skills by coding along with each project and reviewing the code to make sure I understand the thinking behind it.

I will also use this as an opportunity to practice using Git and Github. I have created a local repo and will have a branch for each project I work on. I will push each project branch when complete to my remote github repo. Each project will have a corresponding branch on the github repo as well.

For clarity, setup files are provided by the course instructor. Setup files include HTML file with boilerplate, CSS file with styling already included and blank JS file. Follow along is done on the HTML and JS files.

Thanks for reading!
